"Hope" is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all. - Emily Dickinson

I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain. - Emily Dickinson
